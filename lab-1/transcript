REPORTING IN WASHINGTON.
I’M JACKIE DEFUSCO.
WELL, WE’VE BEEN WATCHING THE
RADAR A LOT OVER THE LAST COUPLE
OF DAYS.
AND SO HOW MUCH SNOW HAS FALLEN?
WELL, IF YOU LOOK HERE, YOU CAN
SEE THERE’S BEEN A COUPLE BANDS
OUT ACROSS NORTHERN OKLAHOMA.
AND THEN JUST SOUTH OF I-40, WE
HAD SOME SNOW LAST NIGHT, AND
THEN WE PICKED UP A BIT MORE
THIS AFTERNOON.
SO JUST GOT TO UPDATE, BY THE
WAY, JUST EAST OF WOODWARD AND
MORELAND, ABOUT FOUR INCHES OF
SNOW HAS FALLEN, BUT NORTHERN
OKLAHOMA HAS BEEN A LOT OF TWO
TWO AND A HALF THREE INCH SNOW
TOTALS.
AND THEN SOUTH OF I-40 IT’S BEEN
THREE, FOUR AND EVEN A FEW AREAS
AROUND 4.5IN OF SNOW.
BUT WE’RE GOING TO BE ADDING
QUITE A BIT MORE TO THIS FOR
TONIGHT.
AND THEN THE TEMPERATURES ARE
REALLY GOING TO DROP.
SO THIS IS WHAT THE RADAR LOOKS
LIKE RIGHT NOW.
IT’S A LOT MORE SNOW.
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME SLEET
PELLETS MIXED IN WITH THIS
SYSTEM.
AND EVEN AT TIMES WHICH IS
REALLY WILD AT NINE DEGREES,
FREEZING DRIZZLE OUT THERE.
WHEN YOU GET FREEZING DRIZZLE AT
NINE DEGREES, BY THE WAY, THINGS
CAN ICE OVER PRETTY QUICKLY.
SO HOW DO YOU READ THIS RADAR?
BECAUSE IT’S IN SNOW MODE RIGHT
NOW.
THE HEAVIER SNOW BANDS ARE GOING
TO BE THE DARKER BLUES.
SO CEILING FAIRVIEW CERTAINLY
SEEING IT THERE FROM BANGOR TO
CORN THAT IS MOVING UP INTO
WESTERN CANADIAN COUNTY.
GUTHRIE TO STILLWATER UP TOWARDS
OSAGE AND THEN DOWN INTO
SOUTHERN AND SOUTHEASTERN
OKLAHOMA.
STILL FINDING THAT PINK ON THE
RADAR.
THAT IS GOING TO BE ICE, MAINLY
SLEET AND SOME POCKETS OF
FREEZING RAIN, ALTHOUGH
TEMPERATURES ARE WELL BELOW
FREEZING.
SO PAULS VALLEY WYNNEWOOD DOWN
TO SULFUR.
SNOW IS COMING IN HERE.
LET ME CHECK IN WITH JASON HILL
HERE.
JASON, YOU’VE BEEN OUT SINCE
YESTERDAY.
YOU’VE SEEN MANY ROUNDS OF SNOW
AND ICE MOVE IN.
HOW ARE THE ROADS LOOKING RIGHT
NOW?
JASON DAMON, WE’RE ON 35 NORTH
AND WE’RE HEADING UP TOWARDS
GUTHRIE.
WE’RE FIXING TO START ROLLING
THROUGH EDMOND HERE PRETTY
QUICK.
WE’VE GOT ONE LANE THAT’S PRETTY
CLEAR.
WE HAVE SEVERAL SNOWPLOW CREWS
ON EITHER SIDE OF I-35.
DID A GREAT JOB SALTING AND
SANDING THESE ROADS.
LOOK AT THAT.
WE’VE GOT TWO LANES NOW.
THEY’RE REALLY DOING THE BEST
THEY CAN TO TRY AND PREPARE FOR
THIS ROUND THAT’S COMING IN.
WE’VE GOT SOME LIGHT TO MODERATE
SLEET THAT IS FALLING RIGHT NOW.
AND WE’RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO
WATCH THIS.
WE’RE GOING TO MAKE OUR WAY UP
TOWARDS GUTHRIE WHERE THESE
HEAVIER BANDS ARE.
AND WE WILL DEFINITELY COME BACK
WITH FIRST ALERT.
BACK TO YOU.
ALL RIGHT.
YEAH.
AND LOOKING RIGHT HERE, JUST
JASON SHOT THREE LANE HIGHWAY,
TWO LANES.
LOOK.
ALL RIGHT, BUT SOMETIMES THE
LANES MAY NOT LINE UP PERFECTLY
TO THE LINES HERE.
THIS ONE LOOKS LIKE IT IS.
BUT JUST KNOW THAT SOMETIMES THE
LANES CAN KIND OF MOVE AROUND
THERE.
SO IF YOU’RE HEADED OUT TONIGHT,
JUST KEEP THAT IN MIND.
THERE REALLY HASN’T BEEN A TON
OF TRAFFIC OUT THERE THIS
AFTERNOON, THANKFULLY, BECAUSE
IT IS A SATURDAY.
SO A LOT OF THINGS HAVE, YOU
KNOW, OBVIOUSLY BEEN SHUT DOWN.
SCHOOLS WERE CLOSED YESTERDAY,
WILL LIKELY BE CLOSED A FEW DAYS
INTO NEXT WEEK.
LET’S GO UP INTO NORTHERN
OKLAHOMA.
HEY, SHANE, JUST GOT AN UPDATE
FROM YOUR HOMETOWN THERE IN
EASTERN WOODWARD COUNTY OF SOME
DECENT SNOW.
HOW’S THE SNOW LOOKING RIGHT
NOW?
JUST NORTH OF PERRY.
SHANE.
WELL, I’LL TELL YOU WHAT.
SAME THING OVER HERE AT THE
INTERSECTION OF HIGHWAY 412 AND
I-35.
THERE IS FOUR INCHES OF SNOW ON
THE GROUND.
WE HAVE BEEN UP HERE ALL DAY
LONG BETWEEN ENID PERRY AND
TONKAWA AND BACK AND FORTH.
AND I’LL TELL YOU WHAT.
IT’S BEEN SNOWING HERE ALL DAY
LONG.
SOMETIMES, LIKE RIGHT NOW, REAL
FINE DUST, LIKE SNOW.
AND THEN SOMETIMES BIG
SNOWFLAKES.
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT’S GOING TO
BE COMING, BECAUSE ONE MINUTE
IT’S LITTLE BITTY STUFF AND THE
NEXT MINUTE IT’S LARGE.
BUT WE WE CAN SAY THIS, LIKE I
SAID, FOUR INCHES OF SNOW.
BUT THE REALLY SAD PART IS, IS
THAT THIS IS A REALLY DRY SNOW
AND IT’S NOT GOOD FOR MAKING
SNOWBALLS.
SO IF YOU WANT TO GO OUT AND
HAVE A SNOWBALL FIGHT OR
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, YOU’RE
PROBABLY GOING TO HAVE A HARD
TIME MAKING SNOWBALLS IN THIS.
EVEN BACK TO YOU.
THAT IS VERY TRUE.
YEAH, KIND OF JUST FALLS APART
THERE.
SO SHANE UP IN NORTHERN OKLAHOMA
AND YOU CAN SEE HERE ONE LANE
THERE ON I-35 ON THE HIGHWAY
THERE, THAT IS CLEAR.
SO THE THE DRIVING CONDITIONS
ARE GOING TO VARY.
BUT AS WE’VE BEEN SAYING FOR A
WHILE HERE, ALL IN ALL JUST HANG
TIGHT.
IF YOU CAN STAY HOME TONIGHT,
THAT’S THE BEST ADVICE BECAUSE
LOOK AT WHAT IS STILL LEFT TO
COME IN HERE.
LOOK AT ALL THIS BLUE FROM
AMARILLO TO LUBBOCK.
THAT’S HEAVY SNOW TOO, BY THE
WAY.
AND IT EVEN DROPS ALL THE WAY
DOWN TOWARDS ROSWELL, NEW
MEXICO.
SO WHILE YOU’RE SLEEP TONIGHT,
IT IS GOING TO SNOW AND IT’S
GOING TO SNOW QUITE A BIT.
SO LET ME WALK YOU THROUGH THE
TIMELINE HERE AND HOW LONG IT’S
GOING TO TAKE FOR THIS SYSTEM TO
MOVE OUT.
SO HERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW ABOUT
5:00.
THE THE PURPLE HERE IS SNOW.
THE PINK IS GOING TO BE ICE AND
SLEET.
AND BECAUSE THE SLEET LINE IS
GOING TO BE REALLY CLOSE TO US,
CANNOT RULE OUT A FEW SLEET
PELLETS FALLING IN WITH THE
SNOW.
SO IT MAY GET A LITTLE LOUD
THERE FOR A BIT.
BUT TONIGHT AT 9:00 IT’S SNOW
FOR PONCA CITY, STILLWATER,
OKLAHOMA CITY, ALL THE WAY OUT
TO ELK CITY.
AND THEN BY MIDNIGHT, SNOW WRAPS
UP A BIT THERE FOR WOODWARD AND
NORTH, BUT IT’S STILL SNOWING IN
CENTRAL OKLAHOMA, DOWN TO PAULS
VALLEY.
DUNCAN LAWTON TOMORROW MORNING
AT 4 A.M.
THIS IS GOING TO BE OUR FINAL
PUSH OF SNOW RIGHT HERE FROM THE
METRO AND SOUTHWEST.
BY 7 A.M.
THE SNOW IS MOVING OUT OF HERE,
AND BY 9 A.M. WE ARE DONE WITH
THIS STORM.
SO HOW MUCH MORE SNOW IS GOING
TO FALL?
WE’RE GOING TO LOOK AT A QUARTER
HERE FROM ELK CITY.
ALTUS CLINTON, HOBART
KINGFISHER, OKC NORMAN
STILLWATER UP INTO NORTHEASTERN
OKLAHOMA, UP TO EIGHT INCHES
ABOUT 4 TO 8IN NORTHWESTERN
SOUTHEASTERN OKLAHOMA ABOUT 1 TO
2.
BUT YOU CAN REALLY SEE THE
FAVORITE SPOT HERE.
PONCA CITY DOWN THE PAULS
VALLEY, ELK CITY UP INTO
NORTHEASTERN OKLAHOMA FOR
ADDITIONAL SNOW ON TOP OF WHAT
IS ALREADY FALLEN.
SO YOU TAKE THE FOUR INCHES THAT
SOME OF US HAVE ALREADY PICKED
UP, AND YOU ADD ANOTHER FOUR UP
TO EIGHT INCHES.
AND WHEN ALL IS SAID AND DONE,
I’D SAY ABOUT 8 TO 12 ISOLATED
HERE.
BUT THAT WILL BE KIND OF A
GENERAL CONSENSUS THAT WE’LL SEE
HERE IN THE DARK BLUE.
ON THE OTHER HAND, AFTER THE
SNOW MOVES OUT AS IF IT’S NOT
COLD ENOUGH ALREADY, IT WILL BE
GETTING EVEN COLDER.
RIGHT NOW IT IS EIGHT FEELS LIKE
MINUS TEN AIRPORT ALL COMMERCIAL
AIRLINES TODAY BASICALLY JUST
SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE KNOW THE AIRPORT IS OPEN, BUT
WE DON’T WANT TO FLY IN AND OUT
OF OKC HERE.
SO WE’RE NOT FLYING TODAY, BUT
HOPEFULLY TOMORROW THINGS WILL
GET BACK UP AND RUNNING.
AND AS WE GO INTO POTTAWATOMIE
COUNTY RIGHT NOW IT IS 11.
FEELS LIKE MINUS THREE.
SO THESE TEMPERATURES ARE GOING
TO DROP.
I KNOW IT’S ALREADY COLD ENOUGH.
HOW MUCH MORE CAN IT DROP?
5789.
LOOK AT THESE TEMPERATURES.
I MEAN IT’S THREE, SIX, NINE.
I MEAN, THIS IS THIS IS SOME
COLD TEMPERATURES HERE.
AND THEN YOU FACTOR IN THE WIND
CHILLS.
IT’S MINUS 6 TO -15 IN WESTERN
OKLAHOMA.
SO YOUR FIVE PLUS FIVE DAY
FORECAST GOING OUT THE NEXT TEN
DAYS.
I EXPECT THAT IT’S GOING TO TAKE
A LITTLE WHILE FOR ROADS TO
IMPROVE.
BUT YOU CAN GET A DECENT AMOUNT
OF MELTING EVEN AT 25 AND SUNNY.
SO AFTER THE SYSTEM MOVES OUT
ROADS SHOULD BEGIN TO IMPROVE
QUITE A BIT AS WE
